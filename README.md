#The system's primary goal is to simplify academic scheduling by automating the allocation of teaching resources and centralizing course-related data. Administrators will manage a comprehensive database of faculty members and course offerings. For each semester, the system will facilitate the creation and modification of course sections, assigning 
qualified faculty based on availability and expertise.

#Tasks
Create a UI for adding and listing faculty members. Add data validation for faculty names. 
Implement Course Management Functionality: Create a UI for adding and listing courses. Add data validation for course names.
Implement Scheduling Functionality: Allow assignment of courses to selected faculty. Store and display assigned courses.

#Bugs
Fix Input Validation Issues: Ensure that empty faculty or course names cannot be submitted. 
Improve Dropdown Functionality: Ensure that new entries appear in the dropdown menus dynamically.

#Technical Debt
Refactor the UI Code: Improve code organization by separating logic into different classes or modules. 
Add Unit Tests: Create tests for functionality to ensure reliability during future changes.
